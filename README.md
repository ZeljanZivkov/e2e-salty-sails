### Configuration Instructions

1. For the required credentials, please contact this email: zeljan.zivkov@etondigital.com
   
3. Open the `cypress.env.json.template` file and fill in the required fields with valid credentials:  
   
   {
       "httpAuthUsername": "",
       "httpAuthPassword": "",
       "email": "",
       "password": ""
   }
   
4. After adding the credentials, rename the file by removing the .template prefix, so it becomes cypress.env.json
